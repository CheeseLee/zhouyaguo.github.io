 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64 <br>
 * 
 * Base64编码的主要用途在于：将二进制编码后，就变成了文本形式的可见字符，可以用于xml传输以及存入数据库。英文的解析更清楚：<br>
 * 
 * Base64 encoding schemes are commonly used when there is a need to encode binary data that needs to be stored and
 * transferred over media that are designed to deal with textual data. This is to ensure that the data remain intact
 * without modification during transport. Base64 is commonly used in a number of applications including email via MIME,
 * and storing complex data in XML. <br>
 * 
 * 
 * When the number of bytes to encode is not divisible by 3 (that is, if there are only one or two bytes of input for
 * the last block), then the following action is performed: Add extra bytes with value zero so there are three bytes,
 * and perform the conversion to base64. If there was only one significant input byte, only the first two base64 digits
 * are picked, and if there were two significant input bytes, the first three base64 digits are picked. '=' characters
 * might be added to make the last block contain four base64 characters. As a result: When the last group contains one
 * octet, the four least significant bits of the final 6-bit block are set to zero; and when the last group contains two
 * octets, the two least significant bits of the final 6-bit block are set to zero.<br>
 * 
 * The '==' sequence indicates that the last group contained only 1 byte, and '=' indicates that it contained 2 bytes.
 * The example below illustrates how truncating the input of the whole of the above quote changes the output padding:<br>
 * 
 * 三个ascii值最后被转换成了4个可见字符，所以可以知道如果原字符串能被3整除，那么就ok，如果不能整除呢？就补0！两种情况：一种是原来是1个字符（在结果末尾跟上==），一种是原来是2个字符（在结果末尾跟上=）。
 * 
 * 为什么原来是一个字符时，最后补了两个“==”？而原来是两个字符时，最后补了一个“=”？因为就是最后的结果要被4整除，也就是说经过base64编码后的结果肯定是4的倍数！但是长度是不定的！
